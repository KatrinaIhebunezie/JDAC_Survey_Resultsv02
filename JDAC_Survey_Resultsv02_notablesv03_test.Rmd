### <span style="color:#3f366d">Summary</span>
- The majority of respondents are fulfilled by their work and are satisfied with their DD team and JDAC as a whole.  Although the majority of participants felt that their workload was ‘just right’, seven respondents (30%) felt their workload was ‘a bit heavy’.
-   Ten respondents (44%) expressed that their wellbeing at work or home was either ‘in a really good place’ or ‘in an ok place’.  However, thirteen participants felt slightly less optimistic about their wellbeing - ten (44%) reported there were areas at work that could be improved, while three (13%) were concerned that their wellbeing may be negatively impacted if their experience at work worsened/ remained unchanged.
- Most teams across JDAC felt fairly prepared and adequately supported for their mid-year reviews
- Although ten (63%) respondents expressed that they were having monthly developmental conversations with their line managers, two (13%) noted such conversations occurred less regularly and four (25%) disclosed they had yet to receive one
- Most respondents would like more training and development offers. This highlights the importance of potentially exploring training need gaps across JDAC to develop even more training opportunities




### <span style="color:#3f366d">Monthly Questions</span>

#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Wellbeing at Work and in Life</span>

Of the 80 people approached, 23 participated (response rate = 30%) (Fig. 1).  

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 1. Participant Demographics (by Team and Grade)</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs3, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("Demo_1.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("Demo_2.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 1 Wellbeing at Work</span>

```

The majority of respondents (87%) expressed they were either 'in a really good place' (44%, 10) or 'in an ok place, but there are things I'd like to improve' whilst at work respectively (44%, 10) (Fig. 2).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 2 Wellbeing at Work and in Life</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("WB_1a.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("WB_2a.png", error = FALSE)

```

<br> Similarly, most participants (40%, 9) responded that in their personal life, they were either 'in a really good place' or 'in an ok place, but there things I'd like to improve' respectively.  Relatively low numbers (13%) of respondents across JDAC experienced lower mood at work (13%, 3) or in their personal lives (17%, 4).

```{r, echo=FALSE}



```
                                                                                              

#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Workload and Work Fulfillment</span>

The majority of respondents (52%, 12) felt that their workload was 'just right' (Fig. 3). However, a considerable proportion of respondents (30%, 7) found that their workload was 'a bit heavy' (Fig. 3).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 3 Workload Feelings</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("WK_1a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 3 Workload Feelings</span>


```
<br> On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicated 'not at all' and 5 represented 'very well', a median score of 4 was reported for work fulfillment.  Most respondents (8) expressed they believed that they their job complemented their interests and skills (Fig. 4).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 4 Work Fulfillment</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("WK_2a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 4 Work Fulfillment</span>


```



#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Team Effectiveness</span>

The majority of respondents (44%, 10) expressed things were going 'quite well' in their DD team and in JDAC as a whole (52%, 12) (Fig. 5).


<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 5 Team Effectiveness</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs4, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("S_1a.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("S_2a.png", error = FALSE)


#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 4 Work Fulfillment</span>


```

<br> 

#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Development and Training</span>

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

The median response of participants reporting they had clearly defined goals was 3 of 5.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```
Although four respondents across JDAC were very confident of their goals and objectives, nine participants across Data Science, Data Ops, International Foresight, Thematic Analysis and SitCen were not (Fig. 6).  



<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 6 Established Goals</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_1a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 5 Established Goals</span>


```
<br> A common theme highlighted by participants included the need for a clearer and unified sense of direction and priorities from the SLT as well as a sense of a common culture across teams to encourage more connection across JDAC.

Similarly, although most participants across JDAC felt they had either 'some, but not enough' (44%, 10) or 'very little' (35%, 8) core training and development, some participants (4, 17%) expressed they had undertaken the 'right amount' of it (Fig. 7).  








<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 7 Core and Wider Training and Development</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs2, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_2a.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("TD_3a.png", error = FALSE)
```
<br> Furthermore, most respondents across JDAC also expressed feeling they had undertaken either 'very little' (44%, 10) or 'some, but not enough' (40%, 9) wider training and development (Fig. 7).  A common theme identified from respondent comments highlighted the importance of exploring training need gaps across JDAC to develop even more effective learning and development offers:

*"L&D!! What do people want to learn? How do we encourage learning as a group?"*


### <span style="color:#3f366d">Wildcard Questions</span>

Of those who are not exempt from completing mid-year reviews, just 16% reported having completed one (Fig. 8).<br>

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 8 Mid-Year Review Completion</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_6a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 7 Mid-Year Review Preparedness</span>


```
<br> However, as the survey closed on the same day as the mid-year review deadline, it is possible some respondents may have completed their mid-year review shortly before or after the survey deadline despite disclosing non-completion in their earlier response.  For this reason, mid-year review completion rates may be subject to change.

Additionally, although six participants did not respond, most of the respondents (71%, 12) who were asked if they knew who to contact for concerns/ questions about the mid-year review process, noted feeling supported.

Furthermore, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represented 'not at all prepared' and 5 represented 'very prepared', most participants across JDAC felt fairly prepared for their mid-year reviews - the median score of respondents for preparedness was 4 (Fig. 9).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 9 Mid-Year Review Preparedness</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_5a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 7 Mid-Year Review Preparedness</span>


```


However, although 63% (10) of respondents expressed that they were having monthly developmental conversations with their line managers, 13% (2) noted such conversations occurred less regularly and 25% (4) disclosed they had yet to receive one (Fig. 10).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 10 Training and Development Planning</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_4a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 9 Training and Development Planning</span>


```

Responses to this question also include those from staff who are exempt from completing a mid-year review.

## <span style="color:#3f366d">Methodology</span>

Each item in the survey was reviewed within the JDAC Pulse Survey Strand so the relevance and appropriateness could be discussed.  A pilot test  conducted during a Senior Management Team meeting asked volunteers to verbally evaluate items that were not understood.  No difficulties were encountered.  Minor changes were made to the questions in the final version following the pilot.

The survey consisted of 20 questions and six sections (please refer to  Table 1).
